    <div id="aboutContainer" class="about">
      <div id="aboutHeading">ABOUT US</div>
      <div id="aboutText">The Maritime Archaeology and Heritage Institute (MAHI) is a non-profit, autonomous research organisation dedicated to the investigation and preservation of maritime cultural heritage in the Western Indian Ocean.<br style="line-height: 10px;"><br>
        Based in Pakistan, MAHI is led by international experts in the fields of maritime archaeology and cultural heritage management, who bring with them decades of operational experience on cultural heritage projects in the Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific regions.<br style="line-height: 10px;"><br>
        The exploration and study of maritime archaeological sites requires highly specialised technical and professional skills in every stage of investigation, from initial archaeological and geophysical surveys, to more complex documentation techniques in terrestrial and underwater environments, to the conservation, interpretation and management of new discoveries for a diverse audience. As such research has not previously been undertaken in Pakistan, MAHI aims to draw on a broad network of multidisciplinary regional and international experts to deliver on its research objectives.<br style="line-height: 10px;"><br>
        MAHI supports the aims of the UNESCO Convention for the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage and the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030).
